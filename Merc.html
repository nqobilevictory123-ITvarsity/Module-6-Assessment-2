                <p>Mercedes-Benz has at times had a reputation for quality and durability. Objective measures looking at passenger vehicles, such as J. D. Power surveys, demonstrated a downturn in reputation in these criteria in the late 1990s and early 2000s. By mid-2005, Mercedes temporarily returned to the industry average for initial quality, a measure of problems after the first 90 days of ownership, according to J. D. Power.[51] In J. D. Power's Initial Quality Study for the first quarter of 2006, Mercedes showed dramatic improvement by climbing from 25th to 5th place and earning several awards for its models.[52] For 2007, Mercedes-Benz's initial quality rating improved by yet another mark, to fourth place.[53] On top of this accolade, it also received the Platinum Plant Quality Award for its Mercedesâ€™ Sindelfingen, Germany assembly plant.[53] J. D. Power's 2011 US Initial Quality and Vehicle Dependability Studies both ranked Mercedes-Benz vehicles above average in build quality and reliability.[54][55] In the 2011 UK J. D. Power Survey, Mercedes cars were rated above average.[56] A 2014 iSeeCars.com study for Reuters found Mercedes to have the lowest vehicle recall rate.</p>
